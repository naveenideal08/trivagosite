# Python Behave sample project
Simple BDD test automation in frameworks: Behave framework, Selenium webdriver, Gherkin, Python(3.4). I used POM 
(page object modelling). Project uses a chromium driver (personally preffered slightly older version)
DOM elements found by using chrome inspector

Automation Code Challenge

Create a set of Selenium Tests in any programming language for the following requirements.

The website http://trivago.com/ have extended their search filters with some new options.

The new options are to filter on hotels with:
Free WiFi
Spa

Write tests to test these new filters.

Test data that can be used for this test includes:

Location: Cork
Dates: One night stay (3 months from todayâ€™s date)
Room: Double Room

Results expected:
Select Filter
Hotel Name
Is Listed
Free Wifi
Cork International Hotel
True
Free Wifi
Jurys Inn Cork
False
Spa
The River Lee
True
Spa
Jurys Inn Cork
False

Assume that hotels would be expected in the top results (paging does not need to be considered)

NOTE:
In your solution we are looking for good coding standards/practices for writing automated tests.
